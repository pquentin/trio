    #
    # The way we track closure is to set the .fd field to -1, discarding the
    # original value. You might think that this is a strange idea, since it
    # overloads the same field to do two different things. Wouldn't it be more
    # natural to have a dedicated .closed field? But that would be more
    # error-prone. Fds are represented by small integers, and once an fd is
    # closed, its integer value may be reused immediately. If we accidentally
    # used the old fd after being closed, we might end up doing something to
    # another unrelated fd that happened to get assigned the same integer
    # value. By throwing away the integer value immediately, it becomes
    # impossible to make this mistake â€“ we'll just get an EBADF.

class FdStream():
    """
    Represents a stream given the file descriptor to a pipe, TTY, etc.

    *fd* must refer to a file that is open for reading and/or writing and
    supports non-blocking I/O (pipes and TTYs will work, on-disk files probably
    not).  The returned stream takes ownership of the fd, so closing the stream
    will close the fd too.  As with `os.fdopen`, you should not directly use
    an fd after you have wrapped it in a stream using this function.

    To be used as a Trio stream, an open file must be placed in non-blocking
    mode.  Unfortunately, this impacts all I/O that goes through the
    underlying open file, including I/O that uses a different
    file descriptor than the one that was passed to Trio. If other threads
    or processes are using file descriptors that are related through `os.dup`
    or inheritance across `os.fork` to the one that Trio is using, they are
    unlikely to be prepared to have non-blocking I/O semantics suddenly
    thrust upon them.  For example, you can use ``FdStream(os.dup(0))`` to
    obtain a stream for reading from standard input, but it is only safe to
    do so with heavy caveats: your stdin must not be shared by any other
    processes and you must not make any calls to synchronous methods of
    `sys.stdin` until the stream returned by `FdStream` is closed. See
    `issue #174 <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/174>`__ for a
    discussion of the challenges involved in relaxing this restriction.

    Args:
      fd (int): The fd to be wrapped.

    Returns:
      A new `FdStream` object.
